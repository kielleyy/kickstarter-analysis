# kickstarter-analysis
*Performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends of theater campaigns*

## How the work came to be
###### Careful Instructions
Following step-by-step instructions laid out for me in the online bootcamp tool, I generated two charts that reflect the success of theater kickstarter campaigns based on time of year and fundraising goals. The work consisted of trying to carefully follow instructions and revisiting lessons from the online class modules for help with the IFerror() function. I found consistent challenges in excel auto-updating formulas with different column letters. My solution was to use advanced search to replace updates within certain columns. One challenge I encountered was in using the Year() function -- in this instance I relied on [Excel online resources](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/year-function-c64f017a-1354-490d-981f-578e8ec8d3b9?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us) for assistance.

## Outcomes Based on Launch Date
###### Attractive launch window
May, June and July are highly successful windows in which to launch a theater kickstarter campaign. While failures are also up during this period when compared to the year overall, the rate of failure increases incrementally here while successes rise rather dramatically.

###### Avoid Winter
October, November and December are particularly rough months for theater kickstarter campaigns. While December shows fewer campaigns overall the month sees as many successes as it does failures: avoid launching in December if possible.

## Success based on Goal Level
###### Not Enough Information
There are very few theater campaigns with high level monetary goals so while the percentage of successes is higher for those campaigns that are requesting less, the relative lack of high level campaigns makes for dramatic success and failure statistics. This data is potentially misleading without richer data and further analysis.

## Limitations
###### Campaign Qualifications and Marketing Metrics
Overall the dataset could benefit from including campaign details that would further aid proper comparison between theater campaigns overall. Information such as previous production experience, estimated production cost, and how many tiers of donation may help to guide future fundraisers. Additionally, information such as how many page visits each campaign received, the percentage of visits that resulted in a donation and anonymous versus claimed donations may help future fundraisers in their marketing and upfront campaign design.
